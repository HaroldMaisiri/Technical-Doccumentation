                <p>
                    Civil engineering is the design, implementation, and maintenance of public works.
                     This involves facilities and structures such as arenas, large scale monuments, government buildings,
                      transportation routes as well as other structures.
                       Engineers will either work for the city or for a private firm that has been hired by the city. 
                      Some civil engineers work in the private sector on projects for independent companies.
                      There are several types of civil engineering.
                      A civil engineer can specialize in a number of different civil engineering branches. 
                      Those branches are described briefly below:

                <p>
                    This branch of civil engineering encompasses the structural analysis and design of structures. 
                    It is the responsibility of the structural engineer to analyze and design a structure
                    that will safely bear or resist the stresses, forces and loads.
                    The design must satisfy the project specifications while meeting all safety regulations.
                    The structure must endure massive loads as well as natural disasters and climate changes.

                <p>
                    Coastal engineering is a branch of civil engineering concerned with the specific demands posed by 
                    constructing at or near the coast, as well as the development of the coast itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The hydrodynamic impact of especially waves, tides, storm surges and tsunamis and (often) the harsh
                    environment of salt seawater are typical challenges for the coastal engineer – as are the 
                    morphodynamic changes of the coastal topography, caused both by the autonomous development of the 
                    system and man-made changes. The areas of interest in coastal engineering include the coasts of the 
                    oceans, seas, marginal seas, estuaries and big lakes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides the design, building and maintenance of coastal structures, coastal engineers are often 
                    interdisciplinary involved in integrated coastal zone management, also because of their specific
                    knowledge of the hydro- and morphodynamics of the coastal system. This may include providing input 
                    and technology for e.g. environmental impact assessment, port development, strategies for coastal
                    defense, land reclamation, offshore wind farms and other energy-production facilities, etc.

                    You can hardly find any discipline that is not related to programming. There is always a link, 
                    that’s the rule. Programming has become the right hand of many of today’s product developers. 
                    Think of programming as a tool that can help you process, store, and display data differently.
                    What more can you ask?   
                </p>
                <p>
                    Programming a lot to do with every engineering discipline, even if the discipline is a non-computing
                    one. All engineering disciplines involve calculations that can be done through programming in an 
                    accurate, fast, and precise manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Computer‐aided analysis and computer-aided design techniques have been developed for all types of
                    engineering design problems. From the early college years to graduation and the start of their 
                    careers, engineers must be prepared to use computer methods and applications as a part of their 
                    fundamental education.
                </p>
                <h3>Examples of computer programming applications in civil engineering:</h3>
                <p>
                    Python programming language is often used in finite element analysis to determine the forces within
                    beam elements in a truss.For example one can use python to a solve a 1 dimensional beam to determine
                    the bending moment diagram in order to determine the required beam size to carry the applied load
                    on the structure.
                    An example os such a python code is:
